Hello! Welcome to my SBA project. I am currently trying to eat more healthy and I find that fruit sometimes gets a bad rap for being a "carb" or "sugary" but in fact my research shows that fruit is a super healthy snack! In this app, I pull in fruit names, photos and nutritional info so that I, and hopefully others, can get all the little details on their favorite fruit. I aptly named this project Fruity Pebbles!
